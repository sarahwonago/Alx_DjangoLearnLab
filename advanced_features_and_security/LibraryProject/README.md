# Advanced Features and Security

In the **“Advanced Features and Security”** project, you will delve into crucial aspects of Django development that ensure the robustness and security of web applications. This project is designed to enhance your understanding of:

- Custom user models
- Permissions and groups
- Security best practices
- Secure communication in Django applications

Through a series of tasks, you will implement custom user models, manage permissions and groups, apply security best practices, and configure HTTPS and secure redirects.  
By the end of this project, you will be equipped with the skills to build secure and efficient Django applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

### Implement a Custom User Model in Django

- Customize Django’s user model to include additional fields and functionality.
- Configure settings and integrate the custom user model into the Django admin.

### Manage Permissions and Groups in Django

- Implement and manage permissions and groups to control access to various parts of your application.
- Develop views that enforce these permissions and document the setup process.

### Apply Security Best Practices in Django

- Configure Django settings to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure data privacy.
- Protect views and templates against common security threats such as CSRF, XSS, and SQL injection.

### Implement HTTPS and Secure Redirects in Django

- Configure Django to handle secure HTTPS connections and enforce HTTPS redirects.
- Adjust settings for secure cookies and implement secure headers to protect against various attacks.

# Permissions and Groups Setup Guide

## Custom Permissions

Defined in `Book` model:

- can_view
- can_create
- can_edit
- can_delete

## Groups and Assigned Permissions

| Group   | Permissions                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Viewers | can_view                                   |
| Editors | can_view, can_create, can_edit             |
| Admins  | can_view, can_create, can_edit, can_delete |

## View Protection

- `book_list`: requires `can_view`
- `book_create`: requires `can_create`
- `book_edit`: requires `can_edit`
- `book_delete`: requires `can_delete`

# Security Measures in LibraryProject

## settings.py

- DEBUG=False for production
- SECURE_XSS_FILTER, SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF, X_FRAME_OPTIONS added
- CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE and SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE enabled

## Templates

- All forms use `{% csrf_token %}` to prevent CSRF attacks

## Views

- Raw SQL avoided
- Django ORM used with proper form validation to prevent SQL injection

## CSP

- django-csp middleware configured to restrict content loading to trusted sources

## Testing

- Forms tested for CSRF protection
- Manual tests confirm SQL injection is blocked
